Custom Shell Implementation
A lightweight, Unix-like shell implementation built from scratch. This project demonstrates core operating system concepts including process management, system calls, and I/O redirection.

🚀 Features

Command Execution: Run standard system commands (e.g., ls, grep, cat, mkdir).

Built-in Commands: - cd: Change directory.

pwd: Print current working directory.

exit: Safely close the shell.

I/O Redirection: - Output redirection (>) to save command output to a file.

Piping (|): Connect multiple commands together, passing the output of one as the input to the next.

## ⌨️ Advanced Interaction
- **Command History:** Use the `history` command to see the last 10 commands or use Up/Down arrows.
  
- **Tab Completion:** Supports smart completion for file paths and internal commands.
  
- **Persistent History:** Commands are saved to `HISTFILE` across sessions.
